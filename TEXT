This game was supposed to be a cute little game where you play as a worm and eat apples, while avoiding predators. While working on making the predators able to go diagonally, it ended up becoming endless lines of color, and thus I left it like this since I don't know how to fix it. But you can still collect cute little red blocks as a pink block.
